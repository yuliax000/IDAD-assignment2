            These two websites are quite similar. The idea of these two websites
            is clicking on different parts of the screen will produce different
            sound and different animations, which provides quite engaging
            experience.

          <h2>Conceptual response</h2>
          <p>
            My concept is a website that changes based on the mouse click
            coordinates of the user, generating some random sounds and ripples.
            The x-axis represents the pitch variation, the y-axis represents the
            filter change, and the generated sound waveforms on the website are
            random. The website needs to have a pause button, a reset button and
            a volume slider.

          <div id="systemMap">
            <p>
              the technique I chose is using addeventlistener to trigger mouse
              action. Create a pad of the same size as the window to monitor the
              x and y coordinates of the mouse. Use Math.random() to select a
              random wavetype. Every time the mouse is clicked, a new oscillator
              is created and connected to a new filter. Their values are
              determined by the mouse position, by calculating the ratio of the
              coordinates to the window size and then multiplying it by the
              maximum value. This gives a value specific to this coordinate. Use
              setValueAtTime(value, starttime) to monitor the current mouse
              value, and update the corresponding value each time the mouse
              moves, achieving the effect of dragging and sound variation. To
              achieve the fade-out effect of the sound,
              exponentialRampToValueAtTime(value, endtime) is used. And stop()
              is used to set the duration of the sound extension.
            </p>

              e.stopPropagation() prevents the area at the bottom of the button
              from triggering the sound. The setting of the "pause button" is as
              follows: when the mouse is clicked, it checks whether the
              audioContext is running. If it is running, it switches the play
              icon to the pause icon, then suspend it; if it is paused, it
              switches the pause icon to the play icon, then re-open it. The
              setting for the "reset button" is as follows: After clicking with
              the mouse, it closes the currently running audioContext, then
              creates a brand new one and resets the volume to the default
              level. The "volume slider" links the current value clicked by the
              mouse with the volume.
