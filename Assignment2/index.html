            These two websites are quite similar. The idea of these two websites
            is clicking on different parts of the screen will produce different
            sound and different animations, which provides quite engaging
            experience.

          <h2>Conceptual response</h2>
          <p>
            My concept is a website that changes based on the mouse click
            coordinates of the user, generating some random sounds and ripples
            or colorful circles. This website aims to create an engaging
            interactive experience by integrating user actions, visuals and
            auditory elements. The x-axis represents the pitch variation, the
            y-axis represents the filter change, and the generated sound
            waveforms on the website are random (the visual part must be random
            as well). The website needs to have a pause button to stop the sound
            for a while, a button to reset all the settings and a volume slider.

          <h2>Implementation and system map</h2>
          <div id="systemMap">
            <p>
              the technique I chose is using addeventlistener to trigger mouse
              action. Create a pad of the same size as the window to monitor the
              x and y coordinates of the mouse. Use Math.random() to select a
              random wavetype. Every time the mouse is clicked, a new oscillator
              is created and connected to a new filter. Their values are
              determined by the mouse position, by calculating the ratio of the
              coordinates to the window size. This gives a value specific to
              this coordinate. Use setValueAtTime(value, starttime) to monitor
              the current mouse value, and update the corresponding value each
              time the mouse moves, achieving the effect of dragging and sound
              variation. To achieve the fade-out effect of the sound,
              exponentialRampToValueAtTime(value, endtime) is used. And stop()
              is used to set the duration of the sound extension.
            </p>

              e.stopPropagation() prevents the area at the bottom of the button
              from triggering the sound. The setting of the "pause button" is as
              follows: when the mouse is clicked, it checks whether the
              audioContext is running. If it is running, it switches the play
              icon to the pause icon, then suspend it; if it is paused, it
              switches the pause icon to the play icon, then re-open it. The
              setting for the "reset button" is as follows: After clicking with
              the mouse, it closes the currently running audioContext, then
              creates a brand new one and resets the volume to the default
              level. The "volume slider" links the current value clicked by the
              mouse with the volume.

          <h2>Feedback setting</h2>
          <p>
            I tried to enhance the interactive feedback. Inverting the image of
            buttons while clicking on the button. For the red dot, it changes
            into a slightly deeper red while clicking and dragging
          </p>

          <h2>reflection on peer user testing</h2>
          <h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Does click,drag and the sound provide enough feedback?</li>
              <p>
                Most users'feedback are saying it provides great feedback. Some
                mention that it lacks visual feedback at this stage, especially
                the red dot.I will think about how to add more diverse
                variations to the red dot. Some feedback mention that it would
                be great with ripples as visual feedback, so considering the
                visual style of ripples is necessary. It is worth noting that
                since no specific ripple appears on the screen, each person's
                imagined ripple may be different. There has not been sufficient
                feedback in this regard. Next time doing prototype, some visual
                demonstrations need to be added to the prototype.
              </p>

              <li>Do the sound create a comfortable or engaging experience?</li>
              <p>
                some feedback suggest that The tone is too sharp and the sound
                doesn't match the expectation for "ripple". I'm considering
                change the tone of the sound, especially the dragging
                sound(someone says it reminds them of a mosquito but I don't
                want that.). Although one of the feedback says that it provides
                surprise and delight, I want to keep the sound and the visual
                effects stay cohensive. I feel like the tone does provide some
                fun part to this project, but there's quite big differece
                between clicking sound and dragging sound.
